        <statement>If the &lt;xccdf:ident&gt; element is included, for tracking purposes it is important that produced XCCDF results have specific meanings. If
            an &lt;xccdf:ident&gt; element is present and it identifies a CVE, CCE, or CPE entry, then an &lt;xccdf:rule-result&gt; of "pass" SHALL indicate
            that the check content evaluated within the rule complied with one of the following:~For a CVE entry, the target platform satisfies all the
            conditions of the XCCDF rule and is unaffected by the vulnerability or exposure referenced by the CVE.~For a CCE entry, the target platform complies
            with the configuration setting guidance expressed in the XCCDF rule.~For a CPE entry, the target platform was identified on the system.~It is
            important that these interpretations of &lt;xccdf:ident&gt; elements be preserved. For example, consider two policy recommendations. One is that a
            particular piece of software be installed, and the second that another piece of software not be installed. Both rules for these policy
            recommendations could use the same CPE entry in their &lt;xccdf:ident&gt; elements. However, because the interpretation of a CPE entry is that a
            "pass" result indicates software was installed, the second policy recommendation's rule would violate this. This can be corrected by using the
            @con:negate attribute, a Boolean attribute that inverts the rule result. The second rule could check for the software being installed and then
            negate that result, thus giving a result consistent in meaning with the first rule. For rules that cannot have their interpretations preserved
            through the use of the @con:negate attribute, an alternative is to have a CCE entry corresponding to the recommendation. Rules that do not use &lt;xccdf:ident&gt;
            elements have no such restrictions.
